# Introduction üöÄ

Welcome to the software repository developed by Ultralytics! All the code provided here is open-source and available for redistribution under the AGPL-3.0 license. We are dedicated to sharing our work with the community and fostering innovation in the field of machine learning. For more details on our projects, please visit [Ultralytics](https://www.ultralytics.com).

# Description üìú

This repository, [Ultralytics/mnist](https://github.com/ultralytics/mnist), is our sandbox for experimenting with the MNIST dataset, a classic benchmark in the machine learning community. It contains code for training several neural network architectures to recognize handwritten digits, an essential task in the field of computer vision.

# Requirements üõ†Ô∏è

To get started with this project, you'll need Python 3.7 or later. Install the necessary libraries by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt
```

The required packages include:

- `numpy` for numerical computations,
- `torch` for building and training neural network models,
- `torchvision` for accessing pre-trained models and computer vision datasets,
- `opencv-python` for image processing tasks.

# Running the Code üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

To train the neural network models on the MNIST digit database, execute the `train.py` script through your Python environment:

```python
# Run this command to train the model using train.py
python train.py
```

The training and testing data are located in the `data/` folder, originally sourced from Yann LeCun's website [MNIST database](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
