# üìó Description

The repository at https://github.com/ultralytics/mnist is our dedicated playground for the [MNIST dataset](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/classify/mnist/). üñê This repository houses sandbox code that allows for experimentation and training of different [neural network](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/neural-network-nn) architectures on the famous MNIST digit database.

# üì¶ Requirements

Ensure you have Python 3.7 or later installed on your machine. The following packages are required, and you can install them using pip with the provided command: `pip3 install -U -r requirements.txt`.

- `numpy`: A fundamental package for scientific computing in Python.
- `torch`: [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), an open-source machine learning library for Python.
- `torchvision`: A PyTorch package that includes datasets and model architectures for [computer vision](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv).
- `opencv-python`: An open-source computer vision and [machine learning](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) software library.

# üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Run

To start [training](https://docs.ultralytics.com/modes/train/) on the MNIST digits dataset, execute `train.py` from your Python environment. The training and test data are located in the `data/` folder and were initially curated by Yann LeCun (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

```python
# Example snippet of train.py to showcase its usage.
# This will set up the environment for training a model on MNIST dataset.

# Import necessary libraries (Make sure they are installed as per requirements)
import torch

# Your training script will start here, initialize models, load data, etc.
# ...

# Start the training process
# ...

# Save your trained model
torch.save(model.state_dict(), "path_to_save_model.pt")

# Add suitable comments to each segment of your code for better understanding.
```
